This Mystery perfectly demonstrates the relationship we all have with Mary and Jesus.  This relationship can be seen with every Marian apparition.

Mary sees a catastrophe coming, in this case, it is the significant embarrassment and social devastation of a host running out of wine at an important wedding feast.  It seems trivial, in comparison, but she cared about this family and that harm to them.

She brings this to Jesus' attention.  She does not make demands of him.  Does not tell him what should be done.  Simply makes sure he is aware of the coming harm.

Jesus responds that his interference in this is not part of the plan.  Mary, putting full trust in him, then turns to the servants (us) and tells them to do as He tells us to.  Whatever it is.

Her trust in Jesus is warranted, and the unquestioning obedience of the servants is rewarded.

Jesus wasn't “wrong” in his stance.  Mary didn't override or “correct” Him.  He changed the plan, as a reward and a favor.

We see this play out in another place in the Old Testament.  When Abraham petitions God on behalf of Lott.  Knowing Lott was in the cities God planned to destroy, he brought to God's attention the tragedy of the innocent being destroyed along with the wicked.

God was not “wrong” in his plan.  Abraham didn't “correct” Him.  God stated that because of Abraham's obedience and trust in Him, he would do this favor for him.  He would change “the plan” as an earned reward.

Now let's skip forward to other times Mary has been a loving messenger on our behalf.  Fatima and Lourdes are among the most known (I also have a special place in my heart for Our Lady of Guadalupe).

Mary saw catastrophe and great suffering coming our way (as well as ongoing!).  She undoubtably approached Jesus about this suffering, but the plan is the plan.

So what was her message to us, just like the servants at Cana?  Do as he says.  She reminds us of what Jesus asked of us all along.  To pray, to fast, to think on his life, to remember his teachings, to sacrifice and offer that up to ourselves and others.  She also reminded us of the mechanism for “mental prayer”, which is incredibly important for building a profound relationship with God.

Mary is very consistent with her role here, both biblically and in modern times.

Do we absolutely need Mary to speak for us?  No, of course not.  We can, and should, speak directly to Jesus regularly.  Did Lott require Abraham to speak to God on his behalf?  No, of course not.  But it certainly does help to have a loving friend add their voice to God's ear, in our time of need.

Mary is a loving petitioner to Jesus.  In our time of need, we can and should petition Him directly.  But it is very comforting to know we can petition a loving petitioner, who is keeping an eye on us and wishes us well and doesn't want to see us suffer unnecessarily.
