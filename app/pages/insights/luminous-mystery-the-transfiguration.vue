  <p>This Mystery has a straightforward message, but it also has several more subtle messages to consider.</p>

  <p>The first, and most obvious, message is about courage and faith.  Jesus takes his disciples up the mountain to demonstrate, once again, who He is.  He needs them to be very sure of this, as he knows the trials ahead will test their faith to the breaking.</p>

  <p>How many of us can relate to this?  Our faith is maybe not as strong as it should be.  Perhaps the gospel and the Church makes sense at an intellectual level, but doesn't quite make it to the heart.  That can make it easier to rattle.  Easier to slide into desolation and doubt.</p>

  <p>However, how many of you have had powerful personal experiences that made their way deep into our hearts?   Perhaps even experiences that felt like they impacted the physical world around us.  Once you've experienced something like that, all the way to your very core, having doubts seems outlandish!  You might as well deny the existence of your loved one sitting next to you.</p>

  <p>This is a reminder of how important it is to foster a deep and personal relationship with Jesus.  Especially in times of difficulty, where our faith is to be tested.</p>

  <p>Another item that doesn't seem as obvious, but is essential to our faith and daily prayer life.  When Jesus takes them up to the mountain, he is greeted by Mosses and Elijah and has a conversation with them about the coming Passion and its impacts.</p>

  <p>So often we see Jesus doing the impossible and dismiss it as Jesus doing the impossible.  But while Jesus does do the impossible, he does so by example.  He demonstrates what we can all do and should all be doing, but to a much lesser degree and ability.</p>

  <p>If Jesus seeks the council of the Saints of the past, to discuss his coming hardships and trials, shouldn't we also consider doing the same?</p>

  <p>This can be controversial, as some see this as “speaking with the dead” and that is outlined as a great sin.  But wouldn't that mean Jesus just committed a grave sin?  That doesn't make much sense, now, does it?  What is missing here is also all the times Jesus said if you follow and obey him, you will not die.  Your place in Heaven is not death, it is life.</p>

  <p>The Saints are alive.  You, and they, are part of the body of Christ, who is very much alive.  You can pray with them.  You can ask them to pray for you.  You can ask them for guidance and inspiration, especially in their area of virtue or relevant life experiences.  You are not worshiping them.  You are not idolizing them.  You are just having a conversation with someone who cares.</p>

  <p>And lastly (for now, as we never stop finding insights!), the description of the Transfiguration I found to be an interesting comparison to what witnesses observed happened to Saint Bernadette during Our Lady of Lourdes encounters.</p>
